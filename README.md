## Overview
A research study has collected bacteria samples from the belly buttons of a variety of volunteer subjects.  It is believed that one or more strains of this bacteria may become an ingredient in a novel food.

This project developed a website that allows the user to interactively explore data about the bacteria discovered within the belly buttons of volunteers.
